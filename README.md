# Adventure Game Project
Introduction:
This was a school culminating project task. It involves the use of multiple different attributes of python to create a game
where you walkthrough a house with different minigames.

How to use it: To be able to run the game you will need a program (preferably Pycharm) where all three files can be opened in one project.
